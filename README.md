# Silently Trans

If u have access to this be VERY careful with what you push and work within.

## After pulling the repo
1) Make a new folder under Assets called ZZ_[nameOrNickname]_Private
     This must, and I mean MUST, start with "ZZ_" and be under assets.
     Mine is Assets/ZZ_kTalagery_Private/ and contains ALL my private files.
2) Create a sandbox scene for yourself. You will work most of the time within your own sandbox scene.
     Need the updated main scene? Copy and paste the scene file into your private folder.
     Need to IMPLEMENT things into the main scene? Make sure nobody else is working in there, then go in, add it, push your changes, and continue working in your scene.
3) Work very often in prefabs instead of scenes.
     A scene is unique, and if someone pushes changes to overwrite someone elses, work gets deleted
     Prefabs are not unique to scenes, so if people are working in different prefabs, scene changes won't afffect the prefabs.

Please bother Karan with questions so we don't break eachother's work. Files can be delicate. Good luck!!
